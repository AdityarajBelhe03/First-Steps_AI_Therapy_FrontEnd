# **App Name**: Empath AI

## Core Features:

- Message Display: Display user messages on the right and AI responses on the left in a chat-like interface.
- Auto-Focus Input: Implement a message input field at the bottom of the interface that automatically focuses when the app loads or a new message is sent.
- Scrollable Chat: Enable scrollable chat history to allow users to review past conversations.
- Auto-Scroll: Automatically scroll to the latest message in the chat history to ensure the most recent content is always visible.
- AI Therapy Generation: Use the pre-existing LangChain setup with LLaMA 4 Scout via OpenRouter to generate empathetic, therapeutic responses. The app uses ConversationBufferMemory to maintain conversational context across turns.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a palette of cool, calming colors like blues (#A0D2EB), greens (#A7D1AB), and soft purples (#C0B2D7).
- Implement a light or white background to enhance readability and create a sense of openness.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Structure the UI like a messaging app, with messages aligned to the right (user) and left (AI).
- Ensure the design is responsive, providing a smooth and consistent experience across mobile and desktop devices.

## Original User Request:
I have built an AI-powered mental health chatbot using LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the LLaMA 4 Scout model accessed via OpenRouter. It uses ConversationBufferMemory to maintain conversational context across turns. The app works in a continuous input loop, where the user shares their feelings or problems, and the model responds with deeply empathetic, therapeutic replies. The chat continues until the user types "bye", at which point the session ends.

I would like you to design a modern, visually appealing front-end for this AI Therapy app, using a messaging app-like interface (similar to WhatsApp or Telegram). The UI should:

Be styled with cool, calming colors (blues, greens, or soft purples).

Display user messages on the right, and assistant responses on the left.

Include a message input field at the bottom that auto-focuses.

Support scrollable chat history.

Auto-scroll to the latest message.

Optionally display timestamps for realism.

Feel smooth and responsive on both mobile and desktop.

Allow easy integration with the backend that sends user input and receives bot replies (likely via REST or WebSocket).

The chat should feel natural, therapeutic, and respectful of user privacy. Please keep it minimal, focused, and avoid any clutter.

This is my code.
